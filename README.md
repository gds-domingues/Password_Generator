# Python Password Generator

This repository contains a simple Python script to generate random passwords. The script allows you to create strong passwords with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

## How It Works

The script defines a function called `generate_password` that takes an optional parameter `length`, which determines the length of the generated password. The function uses Python's `random` module to randomly select characters from a set that includes:

- Uppercase letters (A-Z)
- Lowercase letters (a-z)
- Digits (0-9)
- Special characters (!, @, #, etc.)

By default, the password length is set to 12 characters, but you can specify a different length when calling the function.

## Example Usage

Here's how you can use the script to generate a 16-character password:

```python
import random
import string

def generate_password(length=12):
    # Define the character set: letters, digits, and punctuation
    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    
    # Generate a random password using the character set
    password = ''.join(random.choice(characters) for i in range(length))
    
    return password

# Example usage:
password = generate_password(16)  # Generate a 16-character password
print(f"Generated Password: {password}")
```

## Customization

You can easily customize the script to generate passwords of different lengths by passing the desired length as an argument to the `generate_password` function. For example:

```python
password = generate_password(20)  # Generate a 20-character password
```

If you want to exclude certain characters or add additional ones, you can modify the `characters` string in the `generate_password` function.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

No external libraries are required; everything is handled by Python's standard library.
